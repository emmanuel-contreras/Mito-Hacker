## Cellular Mitochondrial Analysis Toolbox

#### Mito Hacker is a set of tools to enable high-throughput analysis of mitochondrial network morphology.

  - ### Cell Catcher
    - Cell Catcher is a tool designed to automatically detect, separate, and isolate individual cells from 2d multi-cell images. This tool uses the statistical distribution of mitochondria and nuclei across the image to separate individual cells from the images and export them as single-cell images.

  - ### Mito Catcher
    - Mito Catcher is a tool to segment mitochondrial network in the cells. It uses the statistical distribution of pixel intensities across the mitochondrial network to detect and remove background noise from the cell and segment the mitochondrial network. Additionally, this tool can further improve the accuracy of the mitochondrial network segmentation through an optional adaptive correction, which takes the variation in the efficiency of fluorescence staining across each cell into account to enhance mitochondrial segmentation.

  - ### MiA (Mitochondrial Analyzer)
    - MiA uses the binarized mitochondrial network to perform greater than 100 mitochondria-level and cell-level morphometric measurements.

  - ### Nuc Adder (Optional)
    - Cell Catcher, and Mito Catcher require 2d RGB images of the cells, where nuclei are stained with DAPI (or any blue fluorescent dye). They use nuclei boundaries to estimate the background intensity in each cell. However, in some images, nuclei staining is not available. By using Nuc Adder, you can transfrom your images and adapt them for tools in Mito Hacker. Nuc Adder simply adds a circle as a synthetic nucleus to gather mitochondrial background info from each cell.

##### User Interface
All the tools in Mito Hacker toolkit offer interactive, semi graphical user interface through Jupyter notebooks.

##### Software Requirements
Follow these instructions if you do not have Anaconda or Jupyter notebooks installed on your computer.
</br>
  - Mito Hacker toolkit is developed in Jupyter notebooks using Python 3. Since it benefits from a wide range of Python libraries, along with Jupyter notebooks, we suggest installing Anaconda distribution of Python (V 3.7). --> [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
You may follow the rest of the instructions if you do not already have OpenCV installed on your computer.
  - While Anaconda installation takes care of most of the library requirements for Mito Hacker, there is only one more libary (OpenCV) that needs to be installed, which can be achieved through the command line. (You just need to copy and run the following command. (without the $))
    - Windows: Use Anaconda Prompt.
    - MacOS, Linux: Use Terminal.
```sh
$ pip install opencv-python==3.4.2.17
```
  - It is important to install this specific version of OpenCV for compatibility.
  - All the tools (Jupyter notebook files) in Mito Hacker package, depend on cemia55s.py to run. This module includes all the functions used in the develepment of these tools. This file should be in the same folder as the jupyter notebook you are running.

### A note on imaging

Images should be acquired at a consistent pixel size. The software will convert all images to standard 1024 x 1024 dimensions for internal analysis, then adjust the measurements to reflect the conversion in original image size. All the measurements are in pixel units, the user can apply a scaling factor to their data based on their own pixel size to convert measurements to microns. The user should be cautious about direct comparisons of pixel data from images of different sizes. While square images are preferred, there is no limit on size or aspect ratio of the images.
